When a fast-moving cyberattack spreads across the global financial system, Sydney McEnroe, a brilliant systems engineer at the world's second largest bank, is pulled into a race against time.

The only possible failsafe comes from an unlikely source, a handwritten recipe book left behind by Gayathri Ramaswamy, the late software engineer who helped build the financial industry's systems over decades. What appears to be a family recipe book reveals itself to be something else entirely - a cipher designed to be solved only by those who truly knew her.

As Gayathri's surviving children, a United States Senator and a brilliant actor-musician, are drawn back into a past they thought they had already resolved, the story unfolds across one day of mounting crisis and a lifetime of quiet sacrifice. To save the world economy, they must work together to understand the complicated life of an immigrant, single mother, and tech industry pioneer.

A propulsive, emotionally grounded thriller, *The Midnight Coder's Children* is a novel about trust, legacy, and the fragile bonds that hold both families and civilizations together.
